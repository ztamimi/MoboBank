Hello

This is MoboBank and my name is Zakiya Tamimi

I've been a computer engineer for about 15 years, also have a master degree in CS and 2 patents in the area of computational fluid dynamics.

Initially I was building a prototype for a different idea, when this one came to me out of need. As I worked out the details, I received helpful feedback from individuals in my inner circle.

I intend to ask two people to join as co-founders. For now, however, I am a solo founder. 

thank you for your time!
