Hello

This is MoboBank and my name is Zakiya Tamimi

I've been a computer engineer for about 15 years, also have a master degree in CS and 2 patents in the area of computational fluid dynamics.

My 1st startup idea, was back in April 2013, called mobile gaming console. There were multiple iterations, before I got to e-pay, which is now called MoboBank. 

MoboBank is cloud-based, fast, cheap electronic payment and money transfer system for everyone. 

thank you for your time!
