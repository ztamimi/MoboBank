Hello

This is MoboBank and my name is Zakiya Tamimi

I've been a computer engineer for about 15 years, have a master degree in CS and 2 patents in the area of computational fluid dynamics.

the needs of local businesses and consumers is what compelled me to start MoboBank which is a service for electronic payment and money transfer for those without bank account or credit card. 

Over the period of 12 months, I worked out the details of this service and received feedback from individuals in my inner circle. I intend to ask two individuals to join as co-founders.

thank you for your time!




Initially I was building the prototype for a gaming idea, and because of need this electronic payment and money transfer service was born.
